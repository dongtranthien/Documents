Cách Add Variable User nhưng giống như Variable System:
This dialog will show you your current user variables as well as the system variables. You may need to add a local PATH variable if you haven't already.

Variable Name: PATH Variable Value: %PATH%;C:\Python33

This creates a local PATH by taking the current system PATH and adding to it.
